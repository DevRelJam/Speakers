## Call For Speakers

DevRelJam is a meetup specifically designed for Developer Relations (DevRel) professionals. 

Our aim is to move beyond typical DevRel discussions and delve into the core technologies that DevRels work with and advocate for. Every DevRelJam features "duo presentations" by speakers focusing on latest technologies and how they integrate with each other.

Share your favorite technology and its cool use cases in 7.5 minutes at future Jams!

- 7.5 mins: Speaker 1
- 7.5 mins: Speaker 2
- 7.5 mins: How Speaker 1's topic integrates with Speaker 2's topic
- 7.5 mins: Q&A

Total combined length: 30 min

### Selection Process 🐛

- You only have to submit your topic, without having to worry about co-speaker or their topic
- After the deadline, all submissions will be analyzed by AI and humans to pair speakers based on their technology topics
- Talk gets confirmed only when pairing is successful and have been accepted by both speakers
- All unpaired submissions remain open for upcoming Jams

### Important Notes 📝

- Kindly focus on core technology aspects; avoid product or sales pitches.
- Ensure your demo showcases a cool use case of technology integration.
- Be prepared to collaborate with another speaker for your lightning talk.
